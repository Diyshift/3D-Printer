### Instructions:

  * Glue two larger gears to the heads of your M5x40 BHCS using superglue
  * Install BFI as you normally would and adjust top and bottom M5x40 BHCS so that belt runs centered 
  * Once centered install the smaller idler gear using an M3x8 BHCS screw (or M3X6 BHCS for recessed idler) do not overtighten. 
  * Gears should be a snug fit to eliminate backlash. Scale the center idler gear if needed to acheive a good fit.
  * If you would like or need more clearance print and install the recessed idler gear and use an M3x6 BHCS instead.
